        <p id="me">My name is Mohammad Ali, I was born on November 4, 2007. I am Pakistani, but born in the United States. I am the youngest of 3 siblings, my brother who is 11 years older than myself and my sister who is 9 years older than myself. I grew up in an age that was ever-growing with the constant improvement of technology. Growing up with 2 older siblings, my sister took almost the parental role and acted as a mother to me. I had been involved in video games since a young age due to my brother's influence and my constant nagging which had allowed me to get time playing when I wanted. Though I would not refer to myself as spoiled I know at times I was given treatment that I likely should not have got. Throughout my life I have never been a very social person, though I do like interacting with others I prefer much smaller groups and typically struggle talking to other people especially in larger environments. </p>

            <span id="yellow"> Pokemon: </span> I am a big fan of pokemon and have played most pokemon games. I watched nearly every episode of the anime too besides the most recent series. My favorite pokemon in terms of looks is Umbreon. <br>
            <span id="red"> Gaming: </span> I play more video games than I probably should be playing and spend a lot of time indoors. I like hanging out with my friends though I mainly have friends that I'm really close with. Recently I've been playing a lot of Valorant and Minecraft. <br>
            <span id="black"> Fitness: </span> I go out to workout around 5 times a week sometimes 6 if I'm feeling like it. I was mainly encouraged to start through my brother who is a workout fanatic. <br>
            <span id="aqua"> Music: </span> My taste in music is rather odd. I listen to a ton of emo music, but I listen to nearly every genre besides country. My favorite band at the moment might be <i>Set It Off</i>, but my favorite song is likely <i>Honeypie</i> by <i>JAWNY</i>. <br>
            <span id="kayla"> Friends: </span> Although I don't hang out with my friends often I would like to spend more time with them in the near future, especially before I go to college. Specifically my two closest friends who I hope to hang out with lots especially compared to how much I had been hanging out with them. Though one goes to my school I would have to take time to travel to see my other friend. My hope is to get closer to both of these people both in their own ways so I can hopefully have built lifelong relations with them.
